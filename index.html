    <h2> What Jobs I am Looking For
    </h2>
  </div>
  <div class = "jobspar">
    <p> Looking for a career in web application development or software engineering. Small or big companies, doesn’t matter to me. Just want a career where I can put my development and/or design skills to use and be proud of my work. Designing is a part of the development process I really enjoy and would like a position where I can use my programming skills in a context where I am designing some aspect of the overall product, be it the program architecture or the GUI. Either role in development is suitable for me, as I have tried to develop my skills for multiple potential positions.
